# FaceRecognition
A Python project for real-time face recognition using OpenCV and NumPy, with training and recognition components. The system utilizes haarcascades for face detection and LBPH for recognition, making it suitable for various applications.
# Face Recognition using OpenCV

This repository contains a simple Python project for face recognition using OpenCV. The project consists of three main files: `01_face_dataset.py` for data collection, `02_face_training.py` for model training, and `03_face_recognition.py` for real-time recognition.

## Installation

Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- NumPy: `pip install numpy`
- Pillow (PIL): `pip install Pillow`

## Usage

Follow these steps to collect and recognize faces:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. To collect faces as data, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python 01_face_dataset.py
and then run the other two files using the same way or in your editor
